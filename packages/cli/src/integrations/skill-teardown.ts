/**
 * The agent homes a pre-0.42 `ok init` created skill copies in, for tools OK

 *
 * Until 0.42 the install shelled out to `npx skills … --agent '*' -g`, which
 * skipped that CLI's host detection and wrote into every host in its registry
 * (issue #820). This is the observed result of that command against a pristine
 * `$HOME`, minus the hosts OK still installs to.
 *
 * FROZEN — a historical record of what one shipped version did, not a mirror of
 * anything upstream. It can never need updating: no future OK version writes
 * these paths, and the third-party registry growing further is irrelevant
 * because no OK build will ever have fanned out to the new entries. Deletion
 * only; never an install target.
 *
 * `hostDir` is the parent of `skills/`, so nested agent homes (`.astrbot/data`,
 * `.tabnine/agent`) are expressed exactly as they were written.
 *
 * `pruneRoot` is the TOPMOST dir OK may remove once it is empty — hardcoded per
 * entry rather than derived, so pruning can only ever delete a directory whose
 * name is an agent home from this list. It is NOT always `hostDir`'s first
 * segment: the XDG entries live under the shared `~/.config`, which OK must
 * never remove even if it happens to be empty, so their root stops at the
 * tool's own folder (`.config/goose`, not `.config`).
