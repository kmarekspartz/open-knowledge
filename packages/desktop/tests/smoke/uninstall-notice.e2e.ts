/**
 * Both notice shapes as the user meets them: the real bundled React screens in
 * real Electron windows, answered through the real `okUninstall` bridge.
 *
 * The dom tests cover the screen against hand-built callbacks, but only main
 * decides what an unanswered window means, and it decides opposite things for
 * the two shapes — a two-button question cancels, a single-button recap
 * confirms. That asymmetry is load-bearing (getting it backwards either quits
 * the flow early or strands a half-uninstalled app) and it is only observable
 * end to end, so it is asserted here.
 *
 * Skip conditions match the other smokes: `OK_DESKTOP_E2E_SMOKE=1` opt-in,
 * darwin only, and a prior `pnpm run build:desktop`.
