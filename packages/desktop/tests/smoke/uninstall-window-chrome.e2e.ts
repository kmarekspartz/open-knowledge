/**
 * The uninstall renderer's design-fidelity smoke — the assertion the whole
 * dedicated-entry migration exists to make true.
 *
 * The screens it replaces were inline `data:text/html` documents, which have
 * no base URL for a relative `@font-face` and shipped a `default-src 'none'`
 * CSP with no `font-src`; the app's Inter silently fell back to the macOS
 * system font. So the load-bearing assertion here is that the font actually
 * LOADED.
 *
 * Two obvious oracles are both worthless here, and a mutation run proved it:
 * `getComputedStyle().fontFamily` reads "Inter Variable, …" straight off the
 * declared stack whether or not anything loaded, and `document.fonts.check()`
 * answers "can text render without waiting for a download", which is TRUE for
 * an undefined family because the fallback is already available — a build with
 * the entry's font import stripped passed a `check()`-based version of this
 * test. Only the `FontFaceSet` entries discriminate: the family must be
 * REGISTERED (an `@font-face` reached this document) and at least one of its
 * faces must have reached `status === 'loaded'` (the file was really fetched).
 *
 * Design tokens are compared against the editor entry's own window in the same
 * launch rather than against a hardcoded value, so the two entries are proven
 * to resolve the same `globals.css`.
 *
 * Skip conditions match the other smokes: `OK_DESKTOP_E2E_SMOKE=1` opt-in,
 * darwin only, and a prior `pnpm run build:desktop`.
