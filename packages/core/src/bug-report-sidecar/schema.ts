/**
 * Zod schema for a bug-report sidecar — one small YAML file per generated
 * report, written next to its zip in `~/.ok/bug-reports/` (same basename,
 * `.yaml`). It records the report's last-known send state so the history list
 * can show, retry, and clean up prior reports across dialog close and app
 * restart. The zip is the payload; the sidecar is the durable record.
 *
 * Boundary class: a machine-written, machine-read, durable on-disk format that
 * must evolve gracefully. The pressures (per typescript-api-design):
 *   - additive evolution — a `version` field, an OPEN `state`, all new fields
 *     optional, so a newer app's sidecar never crashes an older app and vice
 *     versa;
 *   - one schema is the single source of truth for both the type and the
 *     validator;
 *   - forgiving reads — a pre-feature zip has no sidecar, and a corrupt or
 *     newer sidecar must degrade to a placeholder row, never break the list.
 *
 * The state machine is enforced by the WRITER (desktop main), not by this
 * schema: `state` is a plain string here so an unknown value read from a newer
 * app normalizes to `'unknown'` rather than rejecting the file (an anti-pattern
 * "closed response enum" would). `version` is `.catch`-guarded for the same
 * reason — a malformed version never rejects the whole file.
 *
 * Reuses the same YAML-write + Zod idioms as `skill-state/schema.ts`, but its
 * reader synthesizes a degraded row on parse failure instead of dropping the
 * file.
