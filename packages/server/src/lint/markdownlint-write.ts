/**
 * Native markdownlint config WRITE surface. The settings GUI edits the project's
 * own `.markdownlint.*` file (the source of truth — see `markdownlint-discovery`);
 * this merges a single rule change into it, format-preserving and atomic.
 *
 * Read-only discovery + this writer are the only `.markdownlint.*` I/O paths.
 * Writes target the ROOT file even though discovery cascades per-dir — a
 * settings edit is a project-level act; folder files are authored by hand.
 *
 * JSON-family files (`.json` / `.jsonc` / `.markdownlintrc`) are edited via
 * jsonc-parser's minimal text edits, so comments and formatting survive a rule
 * toggle. YAML files round-trip through the parser (whole-object rewrite).
 *
 * Rule identity is alias-aware: markdownlint accepts aliases (`line-length`)
 * as config keys, case-insensitively, last-key-wins. A set edits the key form
 * the user already wrote (the governing — last — one when several address the
 * same rule); a remove deletes EVERY key addressing the rule, since leaving a
 * shadowed alias behind would resurrect the value the user just removed.
