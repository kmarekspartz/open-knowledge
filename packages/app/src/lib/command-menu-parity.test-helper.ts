/**
 * Shared OkMenuAction classification for the command-palette / menu parity
 * ratchets. Lives in a test-helper (not a `.test.ts`) so the ratchet suite
 * (Ratchet A/B, `command-menu-parity.test.ts`) and the DOM render suite
 * (Ratchet C, `CommandPalette.dom.test.tsx`) consume ONE source of truth. That
 * shared list is what makes Ratchet C durable: a newly-classified palette id
 * with no rendered row (and not on the pre-existing escape hatch) turns the DOM
 * suite red instead of silently satisfying only the id-classification ratchets.
